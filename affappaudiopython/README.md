# AffAppAudioPython

AffAppAudioPython is a Python-based application designed to create unique 20-minute meditation/hypnotherapy audio files by combining various audio elements. The application uses a webhook to trigger the process, selects and combines audio files, and exports the final product in MP3 format.

## Overview

The AffAppAudioPython application architecture is built around a Flask-based web server that handles webhook requests. The application performs the following tasks:

1. **Webhook Integration**: A Flask web server receives and validates incoming webhook requests.
2. **Audio Selection**: The application selects intro, outro, main section, and background audio files from predefined directories.
3. **Layer Integration**: The selected audio files are combined using the `pydub` library.
4. **Audio Assembly**: The combined audio layers are merged into a single continuous audio file.
5. **Export**: The final audio file is exported in MP3 format.
6. **Response Handling**: The application sends a response back to the webhook with the status and a link to the generated audio file.

### Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used for the application.
- **FFmpeg**: Required by `pydub` to handle audio file manipulations.
- **Flask**: Web framework for handling web requests.
- **pydub**: Library for manipulating audio files.
- **requests**: Library for handling HTTP requests.
- **gunicorn**: WSGI HTTP server for deploying the Flask application.

### Project Structure

- `app.py`: Defines the Flask application and implements webhook handling.
- `audio_selector.py`: Contains functions to select and overlay audio files.

## Features

- **Webhook Integration**: Receives and validates incoming requests to trigger the audio creation process.
- **Audio Selection**: Randomly selects intro, outro, main section, and background audio files from predefined directories.
- **Layer Integration**: Combines selected audio files seamlessly.
- **Audio Assembly**: Merges the combined layers into a single continuous audio file of exactly 20 minutes.
- **Export**: Exports the final audio file in MP3 format.
- **Response Handling**: Sends a response back to the webhook with the status and a link to the generated audio file.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- FFmpeg
- Required Python libraries: Flask, pydub, requests, gunicorn

### Quickstart

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd AffAppAudioPython
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Ensure FFmpeg is installed**:
    - On macOS: `brew install ffmpeg`
    - On Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`
    - On Windows: Download from [FFmpeg official website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and follow the installation instructions.

4. **Run the Flask application**:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

5. **Test the webhook endpoint**:
    - Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8000/webhook` with the required JSON payload, including fields such as `request_id`, `user_id`, `sesh_id`, `timestamp`, and `callback_url`.

### Notes

- Ensure that the directories for intro, outro, main sections, and background audio files (`audio_files/intro`, `audio_files/outro`, `audio_files/main`, `audio_files/background`) exist and contain `.mp3` files.
- The application logs information to both the console and a log file for easier debugging and monitoring.
